## Debugging

1. Install LiClipse ( liclipse.com ) -- no need to install Eclipse first
2. Start debug server as described here: http://www.pydev.org/manual_adv_remote_debugger.html
    * follow the "Note:" to enable the debug server menu item
3. Create a file named `DEBUG` next to inkstitch.py in your inkstich/bin directory
4. Run any extension and PyDev will start debugging.

Furthermore it will generate SVG files for debugging.

## Profiling

Create an empty file named `PROFILE` in your inkstitch/bin directory. Ink/Stitch will then run under a profiler and dump the result to profile_stats.  It will tell you what functions take how long to run.

Install snakeviz with `pip install snakeviz`.

Open the statistics with `snakeviz profile_stats.prof`. This will display a really useful interactive graph in your browser.
